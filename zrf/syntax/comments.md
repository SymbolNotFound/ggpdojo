# Comments

Any line that begins with `;` as well as any text appearing after a `;`
is considered a comment by Zillions of Games and ignored when interpreting
the game.

The exception is when appearing within a [string literal](/zrf/syntax/strings),
where it is simply interpreted as part of the string contents.
