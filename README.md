# [GGP Dojo] (https://ggpdojo.com)

A site for General Game Playing: development, training, and deploying.  Includes
instructional material for Dynamic Logic Programming and Zillions Rules Files,
as well as higher-level strategies for building competitive Players.

I will add more to this README after more of the site is written.
So much writing!  But this will be good for anchoring the work of my other
projects around General Game Playing.  Send feature requests and issues to
the discussion board on this site!  And if you're interested in reading more
about the rules of specific games, check out my other wiki site
